            <h2>Micromouse Lead | May 2021 - present</h2>
            <p>I co-lead IEEE at UCLA's Micromouse project, instructing and mentoring 70+ students as they design and program small autonomous maze-solving robots. I designed a PCB for students to use in the first quarter of the program to learn about the needed circuits and practice soldering and programming.</p>
                
            <p>The PCB has circuits for voltage regulation, motor control, and IR sensing, as well as headers to plug in an STM32 Nucleo microcontroller. This design is an improvement from ones from previous years because it features space for battery holders, a programming header, and a UART header to connect to an additional breakout board.</p>

            <h2>Budgie | June 2021 - August 2021</h2>
            <p>Budgie is a rhythm game for music education developed by me, Trevor Guo, Andrew Gautier, Getty George V, and Raymond Song as part of the BruinLabs entrepreneurship competition. The project features a physical shaker device that connects to a mobile app to provide feedback on the accuracy of the rhythm being played. Budgie aims to provide a hands-on, tactile experience for music students practicing rhythm.</p>
            <p>As the team's electrical engineer, I designed the circuit to connect the microcontroller, gyroscope, charger, and other components together, and to control the vibrational motors and LEDs. I wrote the Arduino code for the ESP32 Microcontroller, including processing the signal from the gyroscope and connecting to the phone using Bluetooth Low Energy. Additionally, I was responsible for assembling and testing the physical product, which involved lots of soldering and 3D printing.</p>
            <p>Budgie recieved an Honorable Mention award at the BruinLabs Demo Day.</p>

            <h2>Line Following Car | May 2021 - June 2021</h2>
            <p>In this final project for UCLA's Introduction to Electrical Engineering class, I implemented IR sensor fusion and PID control to program the small robot car to follow a curved path. Additionally, I wrote a C++ library to use quadrature encoders to distinguish forward and backward motor rotation. My car completed the path fastest out of 107 students in the class.</p>

            <h2>Micromouse | October 2020 - May 2021</h2>
            <p>I participated in UCLA IEEE's Micromouse project, in which I remotely collaborated with fellow UCLA student Jason Wu to create a small autonomous maze-solving robot. We designed breakout PCBs for motor control and IR sensing using Autodesk Eagle and implemented PID Control and the Floodfill maze solving algorithm in C on an STM32 microcontroller. We further improved our mouse by adding a gyroscope and bluetooth module. Our mouse first place at UCLA’s All America Micromouse Competition in May 2021 by solving a maze the fastest.</p>
            <p>I am continuing my Micromouse journey by co-leading the project for the 2021-2022 school year, teaching and mentoring next year’s Micromouse students. This role also involves some <a href='projects.html#mmlead'>technical work</a>.</p>

            <h2>Handwriting Recognition with EmbeddedML on the SensorTile | February 2021 - March 2021</h2>
            <p>This project is a device to identify written characters/symbols based on pen stroke motions. When the user writes a character, acceleration and angular velocity data is collected, and the motion is classified using a neural network. The system can recognize six simple distinct characters resembling capital "L" shapes and lines in certain directions. A potential application of this concept would be a stylus that does not require a specific writing surface and can be trained for the writing styles of different individuals. This project was my final project for UCLA's Engineering 96C class (Introduction to Engineering Design: Internet of Things).</p>

            <h2>To-Do Cue Queue (IDEAHacks) | January 2021</h2>
            <p>This project is an internet connected checklist to improve organization and focus in a remote learning environment. It was designed and prototyped using an ESP32 microcontroller and an electronic circuit on a breadboard. An OLED display shows the list of tasks and a 7 segment display shows the number of tasks yet to be completed. An LED and piezo buzzer are used to beep when the user makes selections. An IR emitter/reciever pair are used to monitor how long the user has been in their seat and remind them to take a break. This project was designed at IDEAHacks 2021: Home Applications, a hardware hackathon hosted by UCLA IEEE.</p>

            <h2>Recorder 3D Model | November 2020</h2>
            <p>This project is a 3D model for a recorder (instrument) created in Autodesk Fusion 360. It is based on pre-existing technical drawings for a recorder. I am currently in the process of getting this project 3D printed.</p>

            <h2>Side Table | January 2020 - March 2020</h2>
            <p>This project is a work in progress that has been indefinitely postponed due to COVID-19/lack of access to tools to complete it. All of the necessary wood has been gathered and most of the individual pieces have been cut to size, but the table needs to be assembled, sanded, and finished. Shown below is a CAD drawing of it that I created in SketchUp.</p>

            <h2>Plywood Nesting Bowls | November 2019 - January 2020</h2>
            <p>To create these two bowls, I used both traditional and CNC woodworking techniques. Before hand turning, the bowls were first assembled from concentric plywood rings cut using the CNC router (a test run of this process is depicted in the second photo). This method is less wasteful of wood compared to usual bowl turning, where the entire inside of the bowl needs to be hollowed out.</p>

            <h2>Digital Audio Effects Pedal | July 2019</h2>
            <p>This project is an effects pedal that I created at a summer workshop at Stanford’s CCRMA called Embedded DSP with Faust. It uses a Teensy microcontroller with an audio shield. The Teensy code was written in the Arduino language, and the signal processing algorithm was written in Faust. I made the box for this project using a laser cutter. Different programs can be loaded onto the Teensy using the USB to create different types of sounds. With the current program I am running, the pedal includes a flanger, low pass filter, and echo.</p>

            <h2>Trumpet MIDI Controller | June 2019</h2>
            <p>This project is a wind MIDI controller with buttons that change pitch similar to valves on a trumpet. The project features a wind (breath) sensor to control volume and a soft membrane potentiometer slide to shift pitch either continuously or discretely. I completed this project at the Designing Physical Interactions for Music workshop at Stanford University's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics.</p>

            <h2>Tongue Drum | March 2018 - May 2018</h2>
            <p>The tongue drum is a percussion instrument in which beams vibrate at certain frequencies to create tonal sounds. To design this instrument, I used the equation for the natural frequency of a cantilever beam to calculate the required ratios between the lengths of the beams to produce notes from the pentatonic scale.  The drum features a maple top to produce the tones, hickory sides, and a removable sliding cherry bottom to store mallets and make minor tuning adjustments.</p>
