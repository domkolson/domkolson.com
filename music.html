            <p>
                Outside of engineering, one of my passions is music. I have
                played trombone in various ensembles and also play bass and
                sing in a rock band. I also sometimes arrange and record
                music, which you can find on 
                <a href='http://brasskeymusic.com/'>YouTube</a>. Feel free to
                also check out my <a href='projects.html'>projects</a> page,
                as some of my projects are music/music technology related.

                Curious? Here is one of my musical productions, a
                multi-instrumental cover of "The Logical Song" by Supertramp.
